## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unkelr/subbis.git
cd subdomain-finder

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
python3 subbis.py example.com -w wordlists/subdomains.txt
```

### Command Line Arguments

```
python3 subbis.py [-h] -w WORDLIST [-t THREADS] [-o OUTPUT] domain
```

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `domain` | Target domain to scan for subdomains |
| `-w, --wordlist` | Path to wordlist file containing potential subdomain names |
| `-t, --threads` | Number of concurrent threads (default: 10) |
| `-o, --output` | Output file to save results |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

## 📝 Example

```bash
python3 subbis.py google.com -w wordlists/top1000.txt -t 20 -o results.txt
```

## 📚 Wordlists

The tool requires a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. Some recommended wordlists:

- `wordlists/common.txt` - Common subdomain names (included)
- `wordlists/top1000.txt` - Top 1000 most common subdomains (included)

You can also use popular wordlists from projects like:
- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/DNS)
- [Assetnote Wordlists](https://wordlists.assetnote.io/)

### Integrating with Other Tools

You can pipe the output to other tools:

```bash
python3 subbis.py example.com -w wordlists/common.txt | grep "api" > api_subdomains.txt
```

### Creating a Custom Wordlist

Combine multiple wordlists:

```bash
cat wordlists/*.txt | sort -u > custom_wordlist.txt
```
